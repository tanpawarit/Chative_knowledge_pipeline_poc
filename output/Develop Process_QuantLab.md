The image displays a graphical representation with a dark blue background, featuring a prominent wavy line that fluctuates across the image. This line intersects with vertical bars of varying heights, which are labeled with numerical values. The overall design suggests a data visualization or financial chart, emphasizing trends and variations over time.

The image is a financial chart displaying stock prices over time, with two distinct regions marked: "Out of Sample Data" on the left and "Good for In Sample Data" on the right. The chart includes annotations labeled "WFA" in the "Out of Sample Data" section and highlights the price movements with red and green lines, indicating trends and fluctuations in the stock prices.

Data Usage

- Checking whether a signal condition is important or not.

- Studying signal conditions' impact to enhance outcomes.

- Enhancing outcome solely with signal conditions.

- Evaluating effectiveness of position score and determining optimal solution.

Method : Step 1

Basic Test

- Monte Carlo 50 runs
- 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage
- Position Score Effective Test (Random VS Condition)

<!-- image -->

Strategy Evaluation

Preliminary Test

Sensitivity Combination Test

Position Score Test

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% VS Slippage 5%, 10%, 15%
2. Stop loss 10%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

Theory Check and Result Evaluation

Method : Step 2

Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

<!-- image -->

Monkey Test

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

- Fix Slippage, Stop Loss, and Trailing Stop
- Random Entry/Exit, Signal, and missing trades
- Try to get the number of trades closed to those in standard trade modeling.

Early Criteria 

Comparing between our outcome and monkey test.

Method : Step 3

<!-- image -->

- To prevent curve fitting.

- Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

- Verifying initial equity's minimum and maximum.

Measure

Out-of-Sample Preliminary Test

- Monte Carlo 100 runs
- 4 + 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 2000 runs, 4 + 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% and Stop trailing 20%, 25%

2. Stop loss 10%, 15%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

- Perform at least 300 simulation runs for each OOS Period
- Verifying significant outcomes for subsequent comprehensive analysis: sensitivity analysis, CDF, etc.
- Ensuring efficiency of the backtest result.

The image displays a neatly arranged workspace with a white smartphone, a wireless keyboard, a closed notebook, a pen, a pair of earphones, and a spiral-bound notepad. The items are organized on a white surface, suggesting a minimalist and clean environment, likely set up for productivity or study.
