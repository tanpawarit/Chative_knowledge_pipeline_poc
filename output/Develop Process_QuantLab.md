The image features a futuristic data visualization with a prominent wave-like line graph overlaid on a background of vertical bar charts. The graph displays peaks and troughs, indicating fluctuations in data points, while the bars in the background are labeled with numerical values, suggesting a detailed dataset. The color scheme is predominantly blue and purple, giving the image a high-tech and analytical appearance.

The image is a financial chart displaying stock prices over time, with two distinct sections labeled "Out of Sample Data" and "Good for In Sample Data." The "Out of Sample Data" section, located on the left, includes several annotations marked "WFA" and spans from 1999 to around 2010. The "Good for In Sample Data" section, on the right, covers from approximately 2010 to 2022 and shows more detailed price movements and trends. The chart uses red and green lines to represent price changes, with a prominent blue background highlighting the two sections.

Data Usage

- Checking whether a signal condition is important or not.

- Studying signal conditions' impact to enhance outcomes.

- Enhancing outcome solely with signal conditions.

- Evaluating effectiveness of position score and determining optimal solution.

Method : Step 1

Basic Test

- Monte Carlo 50 runs
- 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage
- Position Score Effective Test (Random VS Condition)

<!-- image -->

Strategy Evaluation

Preliminary Test

Sensitivity Combination Test

Position Score Test

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% VS Slippage 5%, 10%, 15%
2. Stop loss 10%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

Theory Check and Result Evaluation

Method : Step 2

Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

<!-- image -->

Monkey Test

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

- Fix Slippage, Stop Loss, and Trailing Stop
- Random Entry/Exit, Signal, and missing trades
- Try to get the number of trades closed to those in standard trade modeling.

Early Criteria 

Comparing between our outcome and monkey test.

Method : Step 3

<!-- image -->

- To prevent curve fitting.

- Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

- Verifying initial equity's minimum and maximum.

Measure

Out-of-Sample Preliminary Test

- Monte Carlo 100 runs
- 4 + 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 2000 runs, 4 + 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% and Stop trailing 20%, 25%

2. Stop loss 10%, 15%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%
