Data Usage

- Checking whether a signal condition is important or not.

- Studying signal conditions' impact to enhance outcomes.

- Enhancing outcome solely with signal conditions.

- Evaluating effectiveness of position score and determining optimal solution.

Method : Step 1

Basic Test

- Monte Carlo 50 runs
- 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage
- Position Score Effective Test (Random VS Condition)

Strategy Evaluation

Preliminary Test

Sensitivity Combination Test

Position Score Test

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% VS Slippage 5%, 10%, 15%
2. Stop loss 10%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

Theory Check and Result Evaluation

Method : Step 2

Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

Monkey Test

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

- Fix Slippage, Stop Loss, and Trailing Stop
- Random Entry/Exit, Signal, and missing trades
- Try to get the number of trades closed to those in standard trade modeling.

Early Criteria 

Comparing between our outcome and monkey test.

Method : Step 3

<!-- image -->

- To prevent curve fitting.

- Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

- Verifying initial equity's minimum and maximum.

Measure

Out-of-Sample Preliminary Test

- Monte Carlo 100 runs
- 4 + 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 2000 runs, 4 + 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% and Stop trailing 20%, 25%

2. Stop loss 10%, 15%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

- Perform at least 300 simulation runs for each OOS Period
- Verifying significant outcomes for subsequent comprehensive analysis: sensitivity analysis, CDF, etc.
- Ensuring efficiency of the backtest result.
