The image features a graphical representation with a dark blue background, overlaid with a series of vertical bars and interconnected nodes forming a network. Superimposed on this layout is a wavy line that peaks and troughs, suggesting a trend or data pattern. The visual elements are highlighted with shades of blue and purple, giving it a futuristic and technological appearance.

The image is a financial chart displaying stock prices over time, with two distinct sections labeled "Out of Sample Data" and "Good for In Sample Data." The "Out of Sample Data" section, located on the left, includes several annotations marked "WFA" and covers a period from 1999 to around 2010. The "Good for In Sample Data" section, on the right, spans from approximately 2010 to 2022 and shows more detailed price movements and trends. The chart uses red and green lines to indicate price changes, with a prominent blue background highlighting the "Good for In Sample Data" area.

Data Usage

- Checking whether a signal condition is important or not.

- Studying signal conditions' impact to enhance outcomes.

- Enhancing outcome solely with signal conditions.

- Evaluating effectiveness of position score and determining optimal solution.

Method : Step 1

Basic Test

- Monte Carlo 50 runs
- 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage
- Position Score Effective Test (Random VS Condition)

<!-- image -->

Strategy Evaluation

Preliminary Test

Sensitivity Combination Test

Position Score Test

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% VS Slippage 5%, 10%, 15%
2. Stop loss 10%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

Theory Check and Result Evaluation

Method : Step 2

Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

Monkey Test

Monte Carlo 200 runs, 4 Years

- Fix Slippage, Stop Loss, and Trailing Stop
- Random Entry/Exit, Signal, and missing trades
- Try to get the number of trades closed to those in standard trade modeling.

Early Criteria 

Comparing between our outcome and monkey test.

Method : Step 3

<!-- image -->

- To prevent curve fitting.

- Assessing impact of missing trades and slippage on our outcomes.

- Verifying initial equity's minimum and maximum.

Measure

Out-of-Sample Preliminary Test

- Monte Carlo 100 runs
- 4 + 4 Years
- 10% missing trades and 5-10% slippage

Sensitivity Analysis

Monte Carlo 2000 runs, 4 + 4 Years

1. Missing trades 10%, 20%, 30% and Stop trailing 20%, 25%

2. Stop loss 10%, 15%, 20% and stop trailing 20%, 25%

- Perform at least 300 simulation runs for each OOS Period
- Verifying significant outcomes for subsequent comprehensive analysis: sensitivity analysis, CDF, etc.
- Ensuring efficiency of the backtest result.

Monte Carlo WFA

The image depicts a neatly arranged workspace with a white smartphone positioned at the top left corner, next to a white keyboard. To the right of the keyboard, there is a closed gray notebook with a black pen resting on top. At the bottom right, there is an open spiral-bound notebook with a pair of white earphones placed on it. The overall setting suggests a minimalist and organized work environment.
